	AFFECTS: CGI USERS

	The cgi variable in the configuration file changed from:

	cgi = /path/to/cgi-bin
	
	To:

	cgi = true
	cgipath = /path/to/cgi-bin

	If cgi isn't set to true the cgipath variable will not be looked at. And
	if the cgipath isn't set but cgi is true then cgi will run from
	anywhere.
